METAG for C

This project is based on the paper META-II by Val Schorre from 1964.

METAG is written in itself so it needs to be bootstrapped from a C implementation.

To build,

gcc meta.c -o boot
./boot meta.txt meta2.c
gcc -o meta meta2.c

The original version of META-II only allowed productions to emit arbitrary text or the last recognized token.
This version isn't ZASHQUARED.
